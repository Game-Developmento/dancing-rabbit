Welcome to our game! Although it is not exactly like the original game idea, we have created something similar.

## Game Description
You are the player standing on a platform and moving towards the walls. Each wall has a hole that you must go through to keep going. If you touch the wall, you lose. The goal is to get to the other side without touching any walls. In the original game, the player needs to be in a special pose to get through the wall. So the idea of our game is similar to that.

## How to Play
Use the right and left arrow keys to move the player and try to fit into the holes in the wall.

## Scripts

### InputMover
Controls the player's movement.

### ForceAdder
Adds force to the player to move forward.

### FollowPlayer
Makes the camera follow the player.

### ResetOnCollision
Resets the game when the player loses by hitting the wall.
